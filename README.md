# Design patterns applied to a browser-based video game

This is a demonstration of how design patterns may be implemented in practice.
Note that the code could make much more efficient use of each pattern,
but that mixing patterns was deliberately avoided to provide better studying material.

## Patterns

### Behavioural
* Option and Visitor
* Strategy
* Iterator

### Structural
* Adapter
* Decorator

### Creational
* Factory method
* Singleton

## Build
This project relies on the following technologies:
* npm
* typescript
* ts-loader
* webpack

To build, perform the following command in the root folder of the project:
```
webpack
```

Then navigate to the **/dist** directory and open **index.html**.
